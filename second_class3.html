            My aim here was to <mark>compile objective evidence analyzing </mark>Tesla’s ($TSLA) progress in <br/>Full-Self Driving
             (FSD) as of February 2025 to gauge how far <hr/>they’ve come, current challenges & limitations, and whether<br/><hr/>
              hype of FSD from Tesla investors and Elon Musk is consistent with reality.<br/>I should preface this by
               stating that I am a fan of Elon Musk and have always liked his vision with Tesla… Elon singlehandedly <br/>
               carried the EV industry on his back and pushed it forward at an accelerated rate.
